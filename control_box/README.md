# The control Box 

### The main to know

This control is based on a microcontroller that interact with 4 mechanicals switchs. All of these stuff is inside of a box, created with a 3D printer.
The box is powered by a supply of 5V and 8A.

The microcontroller, its role is to manage different event from 4 switchs.

* 3 reserved switch to get 3 customizes modes that are send from the deskstop application
* 1 reserved sxitch to aplly the rainbow effect on the strip led

I had need to use the library [ ArduinoJson ](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson), to can interact with json element from the serial port.
