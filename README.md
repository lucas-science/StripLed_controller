__This project is split in two parts__ : 

* The first one is based on a control box to control the strip led. This box is composed of an arduino to curb each pixel of the strip led. 
In this way we can customize the strip led as we want and add many events that trigger animations. [The control box doc](/control_box) 

* The second part is based on an deskstop application that control the control box, and give to it many data like : colors, opacity, etc. [The application doc](/electron-serialport)
